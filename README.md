# BakkesModImageTest

We have new image wrappers for plugins, so why not make something cool for people to use. This plugin creates a watermark on your screen for recording or screenshots. Shoutouts to CinderBlock and Martinn for the feature and all of the core team for being awesome. Follow the instructions to add your logo on top of your game.

## INSTRUCTIONS
**BEFORE ENABLING MAKE SURE YOU'VE SET THE PLUGIN UP PROPERLY**  
Go to your bakkesmod folder - in your injector bakkesmod.exe hit file -> open BakkesMod folder  
It's usually found at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rocketleague\Binaries\Win64\bakkesmod  
Open the data folder and add an image titled "watermark.png" with no quotes  
Then **RESTART YOUR GAME**  
Refreshing the plugin will cause a delayed crash of your game, so please just restart the whole game

Once you've reloaded the game and the plugin is loaded hit f2 -> plugins -> watermark plugin to set scale and x and y locations.
